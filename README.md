# NeuralNetwork
## What is this project about?
This project is about neural networks and diffent ways to use them. We are only looking at a very simple version of neural networks, but even so the results we get are pretty cool.
## Network Structure
The network is a fully connected network with and input layer, as many hidden layers as you want and an output layer. The hidden layers can also be of different sizes. 
The networks has implementation for the *feedforward* algorithm aswell as a *backpropagation* function you can use for *supervised learning*. To do this you need to know the expected results of the network though, and its not very powerful in most cases.
Another algorithm implemented is the *genetic algorithm* where the weights are not calculating the correct direction to go, but will randomly change weights and biases.
This algorithm can be somewhat powerful if you give it enough time.
